# ViTFinalProject

This will be a ToDo List for Bills.

I was able to create a form that creates a 'sticky note' of the bill that is coming due with the form elements included. The sticky notes are neatly lined up within the div.

Within the div we have the following information:
    Bill Type
    Payee:
    Amount Due: $
    Due on:

There is also a 'delete' button that I was not able to create functionality for.

In improving this, I would like to create a backend so it saves the data. In the meantime however, I am sure that a person could print to pdf if they would like to keep a record of the data they have input. 

Additionally, I would like for the delete button to delete the parent div and everything in it, without deleting other elements.

I had difficulty getting the values of the form to display inside the div but I was definitely overthinking it. I even tried using PHP and JSON strings when I could just get the element values. 

Another thing I had difficulty with was getting the divs 'unpaidBillsSquare' to pile onto the page neatly, and next to each other. I corrected this by inserting a CSS attribute float: left and display:inline-block.

I am really proud of this product and I would like to find a way to make this something I can use and reference for my own bills.
